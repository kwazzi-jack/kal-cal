# Config yaml for 'kal-create gains'

# Choose what type of gains you would like:
#   1. normal = magnitude-only
#   2. phase = phase-only
type: "normal"

# Controls standard deviation of NORMAl gains spread.
# Note if set to 0, all gains will be equal over time.
std: 0.2

# Dimension differentials which controls smoothness
# of values along that axis. The tuple controls the 
# following axes: (time, frequency, direction)
diffs: [0.02, 0.05, 0.5]

# Set if gains should be direction independent, i.e.
# no direction axis
die: True

# Name of output file for your gains to be stored in.
# To open it, just open the file and parse the file
# into np.load. It will be the only thing in there.
